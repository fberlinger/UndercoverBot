    Delight et al in "Developing Robotic Swarms for Ocean Surface Mapping"

    Each fish has an ID, communicates over the channel, and perceives its
    neighbors and takes actions accordingly. In taking actions, the fish can
    weight information from neighbors based on their distance. The fish aims to
    stay between a lower and upper limit of neighbors to maintain a cohesive
    collective. It can moves at a maximal speed and updates its behavior on
    every clock tick.
